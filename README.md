## Dependencies

In this project I've used:

### `styled-components`

I like the approach of [styled components](https://styled-components.com/), because i gives me a more cleaner and organized way to style my CSS, the ability to use Javascript to style allows a more versatile combination of styles with basic CSS and also SCSS.


### `Tailwind`

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) allows me to have a more clean and compact styling sheet and if combined with styled components gives som interesting results.

### `react-typing-effect`

[React Typing Effects](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typing-effect) is a simple npm package that allows an effect to a text as if it's being written in real time.


### `react-scroll-parallax`

[React Scroll Parallax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll-parallax) it's a package that adds an affect which makes an element move awhile the user is scrolling the page.

Here I opted to use a dependency aswell as use useEffect hook in combination with useState that get the current position of the window element and add an onScroll function to the target element.


### `Emailjs-com`

For the form was used [Emailjs API](https://www.emailjs.com/) to allow the user to send an email directly from the site to my personal email address.


### `Deployment`

The project was deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
